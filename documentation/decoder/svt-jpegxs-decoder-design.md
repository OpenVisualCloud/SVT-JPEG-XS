### Source Partitioning

The source picture is partitioned into various slices. Each slice is further divided into precincts.

Figure 1 shows the decomposition of the picture for one component into bands after Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) decomposition.

Figure 2 shows the relationship between slice, precincts and packets.
A slice is divided into precincts. The grouping of lines of bands into packets is shown in the fourth precinct. Each packet contributes to one line and one or multiple bands of a precinct.
Furthermore each packet consists of multiple subpackets where each subpacket contributes to one aspect of the data, such as significance, GCLI, quantized coefficients and signs.

## High-level decoder architecture

The high-level decoder pipeline is shown in Figure 3. Further details on
individual stages are given in subsequent sections. The multi-threading aspect
of the decoder is also explained in detail in a separate section. 

The architecture is simplistic and flexible enough to support an implementation in which
one slice at a time is decoded through the entire pipeline with a small delay due to synchronization between slices. Precincts from slice (s+1) are used to inverse transform precincts (p+n+1) and (p+n+2) from slice (s) if vertical decomposition is > 0.

In the SVT-JPEGXS decoder, a picture is divided into slices.
Parallelism in the decoder is achieved at the slice level. 
Multiple slices from the same picture could be processed simultaneously, where each process could, for example, be performing a different task in the decoding pipeline.



A high-level diagram of the decoder pipeline is shown in Figure 3.

## Initialization Stage

 
 The initialization stage is a single threaded process. It is where picture header parsing is done along with picture buffers allocation.


### Universal Stage
Universal stage kernel is where the main decode modules are executed.
This stage is slice based. It reads the slice header, loops over precincts to unpack precinct, inverse quantize it and inverse transform it. Precinct decoding is described in details in the decoder algorithms section.

### Final Stage
The final process is where all the synchronization is done: Releasing objects and reordering queues. Slices are properly aligned with corresponding picture to properly reconstruct the picture from slices.

When different color transformation is enabled (example: RGB->YUV or Star-Tetrix), "unpack precinct" and "precinct calculate data) is still performed in the universal stage but inverse transform IDWT and color transformation are performed in the final stage.

Moreover, if default slice height is smaller or equal to two precinct and vertical decomposition is > 0 , IDWT is performed in the final stage.

## Decoder Algorithms

The following section describes the algorithms used in the
SVT-JPEGXS decoder per slice. The algorithms are done sequentially for each precinct in the slice.

An illustration of slice-based modules of the SVT-JPEGXS decoder and slices synchronization is shown in Figure 4.

### Unpack Precinct

This module is where the GCLI and sign bits are being unpacked from bitstream through reading coefficients and prediction modes ( raw, vertical, significance or zero).
The process is done at the sub-packet level for every band.

### Data Calculation for Precinct

After the unpack stage, coefficients are being inverse quantized in the data calculation stage.
Inverse quantization type can be either uniform or deadzone.

After dequantization inv_image_shift is performed, this stage prepares dequantized coefficients for inverse transform by 2 steps:
1. Left-shift each coefficient by number of bits specified in bitstream header(IDWT use fixed-point arithmetic, left-shift increase precision)
2. Change coefficient coding from signbit(most significant bit) + abs(dwt) to U2.

### IDWT [Inverse transform Precinct]

Inverse transform is performed for every component per precinct.
As there is a dependency between slices, a recalculation of two previous precinct is needed.

### MCT [Multiple component transformations]

Optional stage that transforms the output array of the inverse wavelet transformation to intermediate picture samples values of the picture (RGB or Star-Tetrix)

### NLT [Linear/Non-linear output scaling]

This stage uses intermediate picture sample values from MCT or IDWT (if MCT is not present) and reconstructs final picture. Reconstruction is done by reducing bit precision (fixed point) and applying scaling method (Linear, Quadratic or Extended)
